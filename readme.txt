-> ToDo List App is a kind of app that is generally used to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the       least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks at any time and delete a task that is completed. 

The definition is a simple one. It’s a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do. 

Most typically, they’re organized in order of priority. Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of paper or post-it notes and act as a memory aid. As technology has evolved we have been able to create to-do lists with excel spreadsheets, word documents,  email lists, todo list apps, Microsoft to do and google to-do list to name a few. You can use a to-do list  in your home and personal life, or in the workplace.

Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritizing the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later.

If task is selected as goal then we need to ask for its completion so at the end of moth or quarter or XX we can decide status of that goal.
